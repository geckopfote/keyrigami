### 1. Keyrigami? What the ...?
Keyrigami is a neologism out of Key(caps) and [Kirigami][1], a variation of Origami. The word keyrigami was first mentioned by u/impudentmortal on [Reddit][2], where I had posted a picture of my [Origamikeyboard][3].

### 2. Before you start 
You will need only a few things to build your own set of paperkeycaps. First of all you need paper. :-) A weight of 120g-300g should work. Next you need a printer to print the templates of the keycaps and you need also a 3D printer to 3D print the stems of the keycaps. Or at least you should know someone who have a 3D printer and owes you a favor. ;-) Furthermore you will need some ordinary office stuff, like glue, scissors and so on. In the wiki, I'll go into details.
